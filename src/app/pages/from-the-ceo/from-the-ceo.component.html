      <p class="block-subtitle blue">2018 was a year of investment by IoD as we began to action promises to our members to provide the services they have told us they want. These services, which include an enhanced digital experience and strong identity, will be delivered in mid-2019, and then we will identify the next services to invest in as we continue to take a prudent long-term approach. The investment in 2018 followed from building up our financial reserves in 2017 to allow us to achieve these goals.</p>

        <p>While we focus primarily on quality and good standards,  I’m pleased to see another year of growth in our member numbers. Our growth in members in 2018 was 4.4% which was down from the exceptional 8% of growth in 2017. However, a 4.4% growth in membership when many member-based organisations struggle to maintain numbers was a very good result and reflects among other things a greater emphasis on standards. Our growth took us to 9,071 members in 2018. We developed a segmentation model for our membership this year as a foundation to customise the experience that each member receives from us and this will be built into the new digital systems in 2019.</p>

        <p>Branch events were central to our activities during 2018. We held more events than ever before and more members attended them. For the first time, we held three national webcasts in front of live audiences of members in Central Auckland, South Auckland and Wellington. The topics supported our three <i>What Matters</i> themes for the year. Hundreds took part in the audiences or by watching the live feeds. Further webcasts are planned for 2019. With the Business Leaders Health and Safety Forum, we held health and safety events for members and non-members in 10 locations across New Zealand, and attracted more than 700 attendees.</p>

        <p>Several branches took the opportunity to link in with Māori Language Week, running a range of successful events including an Introduction to Te Reo for Directors, through to events focused on implementing digital technologies in Māori businesses and the critical elements of iwi and Māori governance. An event held at Waitangi in December focusing on governance for Māori entities provided a very successful end to this series of initiatives. Working with Te Puni Kōkiri, we provided governance training to 11 iwi boards in 2018 across the country.</p>
        <p>We introduced events aimed specifically at the not-for-profit sector and this also proved popular. Held in a variety of formats, these events all attracted significant audiences. </p>
        <p>We held another successful annual conference in April. In August we published and planned international communications for an inaugural global survey we had carried out for the Global Network of Director Institutes.
        <p>In 2018 we carried out a comprehensive review of the Company Directors’ Course focused on attendee experience and currency of content. We have updated the course for 2019 so it continues to reflect current governance challenges and modern education approaches.</p>
        <p>2018 also marked a significant increase in the delivery of governance programmes in the Pacific Islands. Four programmes were delivered in the Cook Islands, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.</p>
        <p>Our board services included a 45% increase in board evaluations on 2017. Advice given on director fees almost doubled from 101 to 194. Our director recruitment service increased from 23 to 26 assignments. There was a 3.7% increase in DirectorVacancies client numbers.</p>
        <p>Participants in our courses increased from 4,258 in 2017 to 4,578 in 2018, up 7%.</p>
        <p>The IoD’s support for the Future Directors programme, which aims to broaden the range of people going into governance earlier in their careers, ensured that 13 Future Directors were appointed to host boards. We also selected 20 mentees for our Mentoring for Diversity programme.</p>
        <p>A key focus in 2018 has been consolidation and building up our financial reserves to allow for our digital transformation and growth in the coming years. Our surplus at 31 December 2018 was $0.6m before income tax expense. Revenue from services for 2018 was $13.2m, a small decrease of 1.3% over 2017; subscription revenue was up 8.3% and director development training revenue was down 6.5% following a particularly strong 2017. This surplus puts us in a strong financial position for the coming year as we complete our digital transformation project.</p>
        <p>Being a director requires a complex set of skills as well as curiosity and a love of learning. The environment for directors is changing. We are in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution – an era of digital disruption that is transforming industries around the world. Other change is resulting from the global risks that our President Liz Coutts outlined earlier in this report.</p>
        <p>Our success this year is due in a large part to our people. They have worked hard to serve and represent directors, and have strong engagement with media and other stakeholders.</p>
        <p>Sincere thanks to our valued national partners – ASB Bank and Marsh – and our national sponsors KPMG, Aura and MinterEllisonRuddWatts.</p>
        <p>Special thanks to President Liz Coutts and Vice President Alan Isaac for their generosity in sharing their knowledge. And a sincere thank you to our members and particularly to our branch volunteers. Without your engagement and support, we would not have the strong organisation we have today.</p>
        <p>Finally, to those of you reading this report who are not members but have a high level of interest in taking a strategic view and analysing risk – whether it be in charities, sports organisations, school boards or businesses – I’d like to encourage you to find out more about the Institute and governance, and consider beginning a path with us.</p>
