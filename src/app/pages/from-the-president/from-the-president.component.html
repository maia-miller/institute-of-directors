      <p class="block-subtitle blue">It is my pleasure to present to our members and stakeholders our Annual Report for 2018. This is my second report as President of the Institute of Directors.</p>
    <p class="block-subtitle blue">2018 was a strong year for the IoD as we began to address some of our ambitions for the future as a growing professional body. We are strengthening the IoD so we can support our members in their increasingly complex roles as directors – roles that are vital for building a foundation for sustainable growth and shared prosperity in New Zealand.</p>

        <h3 class="body-title underline">Considering global risks</h3>
        <p>In September, I attended the National Association of Corporate Directors leaders’ summit, held in Washington. What stood out for me were the challenges we face as directors from disruptive risks. These risks – whether internally or externally driven – can have a major economic, operational or reputational impact. Geo-political, conduct, cyber and climate-change risk were all at the top of the conversation.</p>
        <p>As New Zealand is dependent on exporting, we are very susceptible as a country to geo-political risks. 2018 saw increased tension in US-China relations – New Zealand has close relationships with both superpowers – and this will continue to dominate our attention.</p>
        <p>Conduct risk, which springs from organisational culture, was again highlighted in 2018. There was the Australian Royal Commission Inquiry into widespread misconduct in their banking and finance sectors, and a banking review in New Zealand by the Financial Markets Authority and Reserve Bank released in November. Both identified weaknesses and areas of improvement which need to be addressed by boards immediately. </p>
        <p>The reports were a timely reminder that all boards have a core role to play in overseeing corporate culture, conduct risk and setting high standards of ethical behaviour. Our <i>2018 Director Sentiment Survey</i>, released in November in partnership with ASB Bank, found more work is still needed in assessing ethics risks and discussing whistleblowing provisions. We highlighted ethics and culture as one of our key education themes for directors in 2018.</p>
    <p>Overseeing cyber risks pose a continual challenge for boards. The number of online attacks that impact New Zealand organisations are growing – both in volume and complexity. We published the guide <i>Reporting Cybersecurity to Boards</i>, in partnership with Aura Information Security, which provides helpful principles, key questions and sample dashboards for directors.</p>
    <p>The biggest risk of all disruptive risks is, however, climate change. Our <i>2018 Director Sentiment Survey</i> found that while 66% of boards considered environmental and social issues to be very important to their organisation, only 29% said they were engaged and proactive on climate change issues. I expect this figure to increase in light of the release of the 2018 report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the impending introduction of a Zero Carbon Act and initiatives such as the Climate Leaders Coalition. The Coalition has some 70 CEOs representing about half of New Zealand’s emissions.
    <p>Directors have fiduciary obligations in respect of climate-change risks. Legal action is already being taken against companies and directors in the US, Europe and Australia.</p>
    <p>It is important that New Zealand directors and leaders prioritise consideration of climate change risks through mitigation and adaptation. Climate change also creates opportunities for companies that can be pursued while transitioning to a low-emissions economy.</p>

        <h3 class="body-title underline">Strengthening the Institute for our members</h3>
        <p>It has been exciting to see some of IoD’s key projects build momentum as we continue to strengthen IoD for members. We have grown again this year although our focus is not specifically growth but on equipping our members to be the best they can be.</p>
        <p>We moved forward on several fronts in 2018. We began our digital project which will enhance members’ experiences by providing a new website and building our digital offering for the future.</p>
        <p>We also began to review and refresh our brand positioning and visual identity to ensure we retain our important heritage but also stay contemporary and move with the times.</p>
        <p>Branch events continued to play a prominent part in our activities allowing our members to connect personally. I enjoyed taking part in a number of events.</p>
        <p>Our advocacy increased too, to ensure we provided comment on a number of key issues impacting on best-practice governance. The Institute made 17 submissions in 2018, up from 8 in 2017, which also reflects the first year of increased legislative activity of a new government.</p>

        <h3 class="body-title underline">With thanks and appreciation</h3>
        <p>It has been a big year for the IoD and, as my two-year term will be ending in mid-2019, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to all those who have helped the IoD support our members. Thank you to Chief Executive Kirsten Patterson (KP) for her leadership and to our staff for their enthusiasm, energy and commitment. My sincere thanks and utmost appreciation to Vice President Alan Isaac and our Council for their time, wisdom and support this year.</p>
        <p>I extend warm congratulations to those members who gained Chartered Membership or who were awarded Chartered or Distinguished Fellowship in 2018. Thank you for making a commitment to the profession, and being the role models we need in terms of professionalism and dedication for the governance community.</p>
        <p>Finally a big thank you to our branch committees who gave their time and enthusiasm to create a strong network of directors in their communities. We held 215 branch events throughout the country, up 14% on 2017. Event attendance also increased by 71 to 10,013 attendees. This level of activity in 29 different localities positions us at the heart of the governance network in New Zealand. I would also like to thank those of you who have given willingly of your time to speak at these events and undertake mentoring roles.</p>
        <p>I am looking forward to watching the growing support for our members as we continue to build a strong, relevant and vibrant Institute of Directors.</p>
